				The conclusion “some supporters of the Klan” cannot be drawn from the premises in this argument. In fact, no claim could be drawn because it is a structurally flawed argument. The middle term, people against gun control is not distributed, since it is the predicate of a universal affirmative statement. In the absence of a claim made about all the members of the class of people against gun control, there is no way to connect the end terms in the conclusion. In other words, there is no way of knowing whether any of the people against gun control who are supporters of the Klan are included in the class of people against gun control who are in the class of Republicans.

				Reasoning.<br>
				In the conclusion, the end term, energy-efficient homes, makes a claim about all energy-efficient homes, since it is the subject of a universally affirmative statement; but in the second premise, where the term appears as the predicate term of a universally affirmative statement, it is not distributed, that is, it makes no claim about every energy efficient home.

				All heroin addicts are persons who started as marijuana users, (premise). Therefore, all those who are marijuana users are persons who will be heroin addicts (conclusion).<br>

				At a faculty meeting several years ago, the president of our small college announced that our student enrollment figure was moving us toward a financially dangerous situation. He then suggested that we might improve our student retention rate if we would show more concern for some of our weaker students, some of whom were dropping out of school because of failing grades. In response to the presidents remarks, one faculty member indignantly exclaimed that he would quit before he would let the president force him to give a passing grade to a student who did not deserve it.

				Reasoning.<br>
				The radio preacher who made this claim apparently thought he was making an important distinction, but it is no distinction at all. If the Bible requires interpretation, and it does, then all of its readers are interpreters. The Bible or any other text doesn't say anything until it is interpreted by someone—either by a scholar, a theologian, an ordinary reader, or the radio preacher. Therefore, there is no intelligible distinction to be drawn between what the Bible says and what someone says it says. In this particular case, the preacher apparently thinks that he will tell us what the Bible says, but as a matter of fact, he will tell us merely what he interprets it as saying.

				Although it is true that both the ingestion of arsenic and smoking cigarettes have been shown to be causally related to death, there are some significant differences in the character of those causal relations.

In one case, then, death is immediate and certain; in the other, death is statistically neither immediate or certain.

				Many critics of gun-control legislation have argued that, because gun-control laws will not prevent criminals from using guns in the course of committing crimes, there is no good reason to pass such legislation.
				<br>
				<br>
				Reasoning.<br>
				Those critics are using the wrong reasons to come to their conclusion against gun-control legislation. The proponents of gun-control legislation recognize that such legislation will probably have only a limited effect on the control of crime. They know that the serious criminal will not be significantly affected by the restricted sale and registration of guns. Since the legislation is proposed with full awareness of this limitation, it would not be fair or relevant for a critic to argue against it on those grounds. The legislation, however, could serve other very important functions, such as making guns less readily available as a means of settling domestic quarrels. Moreover, gun-control might have the effect of the number of accidental killings. Hence, in spite of 		its limitations, proponents think that there are very good reasons for passing legislation that would control gun use. A relevant argument against or criticism of gun-control legislation would be one that showed that the stated functions of the legislation could not be accomplished by enacting it or that some other more important principle was in conflict with the proposal (such as your second amendment rights).

				Ex.<br>	
				When a student noticed that his political science professor had used a questionable contrary-to-fact hypothesis in her analysis of a particular issue in class, he confronted her with it. Rather than examining the charge to determine whether it was a justifiable one, the professor, knowing that the student was a philosophy major, tried to blunt the force of the charge by saying: “Well, Socrates must have slipped into our class while we weren't looking. Now what did you say I did? Used a contrary-to-fact what? I didn't think philosophers were concerned about facts.”

				Reasoning.<br>
				Since the other class members were amused by her ridicule of the student, the professor was able to avoid facing squarely the charge against the soundness of her reasoning.
